- Create corresponding database table structure. Save the corresponding SQL in the `db/schema.ddl` file and update the database file `db/demo.sqlite3`
- Create corresponding SQLAlchemy model class
- Create corresponding Repository class with CRUD methods, and create corresponding unit tests
- Create corresponding API routes with CRUD interfaces
- Please refer to the Hero implementation approach
